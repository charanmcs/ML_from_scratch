# From Scratch Machine Learning Implementations

This repository contains from scratch implementations of various machine learning algorithms in. The goal of this repository is to provide a detailed understanding of the inner workings of these algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**: A linear model that predicts a continuous output variable based on one or more input features.
2. **Logistic Regression**: A logistic model that predicts a binary output variable based on one or more input features.
3. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that separates data into classes based on linear combinations of features.
4. **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that separates data into classes based on quadratic combinations of features.
5. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model that assumes independence between features to classify data.

## Features

* From scratch implementations without using any machine learning libraries
* Tests to ensure correctness and accuracy

## Usage

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
